                        <p>Rather than highlighting error counts, we refocused on performance targets - a metric that would be useful across all user groups. This shift allows users to track robots against their defined cleaning goals, such as area cleaned or cleaning hours.</p>
                        <p>Other key indicators were also swapped with data that was existing in the system, enabling faster MVP development without compromising user needs.</p>

                            <p>User testing further revealed usability issues with the side drawer filters. Users often apply filters iteratively to narrow down their search, making the drawer mechanism cumbersome for exploratory filtering.</p>

                            <p>Usability issues with scrolling within the filters were also identified.

            <p>Early collaboration with developers and stakeholders proved essential in streamlining work and shaping a focused MVP. However, design does not stop here.</p>

            <p>The current Analytics feature offers a solid foundation with the potential to incorporate many more indicators over time. As the analytics page evolves with each sprint, the design process remains adaptive and ongoing, continually enhancing the product’s value to users.</p>
